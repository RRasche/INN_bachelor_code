Cartasian to polar coordinates -> 2D invariant laplace distribution xmean = 4.0, ymean = 0.0, stdv(x and y) = 1.0
only x and y as input, not shuffled between blocks
5 blocks with 6 layers per subnetwork.
Layersize = 64, layer activation = leacky relu(alpha=0.2),

trained on 10000 (x,y) samples two times, batchsize = 256
repeated 20 times.
